# SlicerDHub

**SlicerDHub** is an application that allows Fusion 360 users to export models and easily send them to various slicers that are not officially supported.

[Project homepage](https://github.com/HDaveSoft/SlicerDHub) | [ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ ÄŒeskÃ¡ verze](README.md)

## Main Features

- Save the exported model to a chosen folder
- Launch the slicer and pass the exported file
- Simple GUI with tile-based slicer selection
- Add and remove slicers directly from the app
- Automatic slicer icon detection (from .exe file)
- Support for light, dark, or system theme
- "Edit" mode to manage slicer tiles

#### Tested slicers:

- Bambu Studio
- Orca Slicer
- IdeaMaker
- PrusaSlicer / Prusa Studio

(More will be added gradually)

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.10+ (64-bit recommended)
- Required packages:
  - `customtkinter`
  - `Pillow`
  - `pywin32`
  - `pyinstaller` (for compilation)

## Installation and Launch

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/HDaveSoft/slicerdhub.git
cd slicerdhub
```

### 2. Run the Python version

```
python slicerdhub.py
```

### 3. Create an executable .exe (optional)

```
build.bat
```

The `slicerdhub.exe` file will be located in the `dist/` folder.

## How it works

- If launched manually, the GUI opens where you can add slicers or save a file
- If integrated with Fusion 360's export, it receives a file path and opens a slicer with that file

## Settings

- Option to auto-close the hub after launching a slicer
- Theme selection (light, dark, system)
- Data is stored in `~/.slicerdhub/config.json`
